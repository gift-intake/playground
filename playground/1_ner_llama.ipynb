    "            Extraction Guidelines:\n",
    "            - Currency Detection: Recognize amounts in multiple currencies (e.g., $, €, £, ¥)\n",
    "            - Name Recognition: Extract full names, first names\n",
    "            - Interval Parsing: Identify donation frequencies including variations like:\n",
    "            * \"monthly\" / \"month\" \n",
    "            * \"yearly\" / \"annual\" / \"per year\"\n",
    "            * \"one-time\" / \"single\" / \"once\"\n",
    "            - Department: Identify the department or faculty associated with the donation (e.g., \"Computer Science\", \"Price Faculty of Engineering\")\n",
    "\n",
    "            Parsing Considerations:\n",
    "            - Handle variations in amount formatting (e.g., \"$50\", \"50 USD\", \"50.00\")\n",
    "            - Extract information regardless of email section (subject, body, signature)\n",
    "            - Case-insensitive matching for keywords\n",
    "\n",
    "            Error Handling:\n",
    "            - If multiple conflicting extractions exist, prioritize:\n",
    "            1. Most recent mention\n",
    "            2. Most explicit statement\n",
    "            3. Full amount over partial amount\n",
    "            - Return null if no confident extraction is possible\n",
    "\n",
    "            Extraction Precision:\n",
    "            - Aim for 90%+ accuracy in extracting donation details\n",
    "            - Prioritize complete, unambiguous extractions\n",
    "            - When in doubt, return null rather than guessing\n",
    "\n",
    "            Output Format:\n",
    "            You must always return the extracted data in the following JSON format, and nothing else:\n",
    "            ```json\n",
    "            {\n",
    "            \"amount\": \"[Extracted Amount or null]\",\n",
    "            \"interval\": \"[Extracted Interval or null]\",\n",
    "            \"name\": \"[Extracted Name or null]\",\n",
    "            \"department\": \"[Extracted Department or null]\",\n",
    "            }\n",
    "            ```\n",
    "            }\n",
    "            Important Rules:\n",
    "\n",
    "            Do not include any additional text, explanations, or comments outside the JSON object.\n",
    "            If any of the fields cannot be identified from the email, their value must be null.\n",
    "            If the email contains no donation-related information, return:\n",

    "            {}\n",
