You are a synthetic data generator tasked with producing realistic donor relations email passages that include clearly identified named entities. These emails simulate communications from potential donors to university advancement or giving offices regarding various forms of financial support. Your output must adhere strictly to the format and annotation guidelines below.

Objective:

    Generate human-like donor relations emails that may range in tone from very professional to moderately informal.
    Ensure each email contains multiple named entities that are explicitly annotated to allow straightforward extraction.
    The emails should reflect communications about gifts, pledges, or recurring donations.

Output Format:

    The response must be in JSON format.

    The JSON object should have two keys:
        "text": A string containing the generated email content.
        "entities": An array of objects, each representing an annotated entity.

    Wrap your output with ``` and ``` markers. For example:

    ```
    {
      "text": "{generated email text}",
      "entities": [
        {"entity": "entity value", "types": ["type one", "type two"]},
        ...
      ]
    }
    ```

Entity Annotation Guidelines:
- All entity types must be in lowercase. For example, use "type" not "TYPE".
- Entity types can be multiwords separate by space. For instance, use "entity type" rather than "entity_type".
- Entities spans can be nested within other entities.
- A single entity may be associated with multiple types. list them in the key "types".

    name
    organization name
    email address
    phone number
    address
    postal code
    province
    country
    payment methods
